# Cream - follow your noizy tabs

This is a very lightweight javascript application made just to keep track of your audible tabs. I don't know why chrome has not yet included this feature in its production release. 

It attaches listeners on the tabs and windows to keep a record of which tab/window is marked as audible. The idea is to keep a record of all the tabs which are audible and when needed asynchronous update one resource. 

#### No privacy intrusion. No external requests are made. 

Tried to use promises here - very happy with the result, helped to manage asynchronous events but, it is faaar from beeing perfect. 

### TODO 

+ Integrate tasks for creating packaged production code
+ Start using javascript contructors
+ Tests (whynot)
+ Refactor Promises 
+ Make code reusable (got some ideas around using it as an engine for some sort of chrome youtube mixer)
